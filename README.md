Use SeatGeek's API to determine the best time to buy last minute Mets tickets at Citi Field. 

The plot generated from running SeatGeek_api.py and plot.py multiple times in the hours leading up to the game is found here: https://nicholasmontalbano.github.io/SeatGeekAPI_MetsTix/plot.html. 

The results show that you should buy tickets before 10:30 am or after 3:15 pm if you are buying tickets the day of the game!
